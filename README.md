# Mine Captcha

This was inspired by [xkcd 2496](https://xkcd.com/2496/).
Click on the Captcha button to solve a "Minesweeper" puzzle
(which is not really a Minesweeper problem, but more like a 
"tentaizu" puzzle.)

## Notes

There is no guarantee of a unique solution (because I didn't bother to find such
an algorithm), but there is always at least 1 solution.
